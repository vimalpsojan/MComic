Android Kotlin MVVM Tryout

An app to List Marvel comics (https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started)

Started folowing MVVM architecture, ViewModel and LiveData Tutorial by Hazem Saleh (https://proandroiddev.com/mvvm-architecture-viewmodel-and-livedata-part-1-604f50cda1 )

I have been using MVC architecture for years now with new architecture componets I am switching to MVVM, most of the tutorials were java, so I thought sharing Kotlin might help some who strugles. (It's not perfect or using Kotlin features yet will add as I learn)
Project is in early stage, will write a detailed note or blog asoon as possible.
